# Claude Code Instructions

## Project Structure

The `plan/` directory contains essential development documentation:
- **Guidelines**: Review `plan/guidelines/` for development and collaboration workflows
- **Project Plans**: Check `plan/` for feature specifications and architectural decisions

**Important**: Familiarize yourself with the relevant guidelines and plans before beginning work on any feature. The collaboration guidelines in `plan/guidelines/collaboration.md` are especially important when working with human developers.
