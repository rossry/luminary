Geometry math: There are a number of things in luminary/geometry/that should be reorganized to have better abstractions that put the calculation in the place they belong. in general, higher-order points should not be sophisticated about the underlying geometry, and should depend on operations that abstract over the calculation math. if we don't have those already, they should be added.
